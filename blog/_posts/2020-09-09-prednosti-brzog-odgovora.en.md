We have noticed that many users enter a wish but do not check their email
messages so as to confuse other users with whom the match occurs. On the other
hand, coincidences occur in raids, ie. one new wish generally makes about four
or five possible rotations of different lengths. Therefore, the speed of
responding to the rotation notification is very important, because whoever is a
girl before, a girl to him.

In order to reward active users, we have introduced sharing on Facebook, both
when making wishes and when making agreements. Who does not want to waste time
with this sharing, can buy coffee and thus prove that he is an active user.

Active users deserve to be notified first.
