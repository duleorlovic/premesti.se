  site_disclaimer: This site has nothing to do with pre-school institutions, but it
    finds matches and when parents agree then they can file transfer requests. Requests
    do not have to be accepted for various reasons (overloading the group, etc.),
    but this communication can certainly help in this transfer process. Please do
    not post fake moves. When I got a coffee than I work more on developing new features.

  faq_1: Who is this site for ?
  faq_1_a: Move-index is for parents who are looking for moving their children from
    one to another institution.
  faq_2: What does this website do ?
  faq_2_a: When there is a matching with some other move intentions, parents receive
    emails and can continue communication off-site.
  faq_3: Does this site have something with official procedure that is needed to be
    submitted to competent institution ?
  faq_3_a: This site has nothing to do with the relevant institutions. The site is
    intended exclusively to facilitate communication between parents. Parents must
    submit written request to the competent institution.
  faq_4: What is the purpose of this site?
  faq_4_a: Pre-school institutions generally work full capacity and during the year
    there are no vacancies for new members. However, parents have the need to change
    the kindergarten due to the move or have assigned kindergarten to them is far
    away and this site allows them to find a partner with whom they could rotate the
    site, without the need to wait for a new vacancy to appear.
  faq_5: What's the advantage of this site?
  faq_5_a: Parents may try to find a replacement in their preferred kindergartens
    by placing a paper ad on the parents' table in the requested kindergarten. However,
    such a search is rather slow and not up-to-date (outdated ads). Also, the privacy
    of desire is not preserved, for example, they want to change the kindergarten,
    but do not want everyone else to find out, so parents rarely place those ads.
    Using this site, parents can find more options to move since rotation can be performed
    between two (A-B and B-A) or more members (A-B, B-V, V-G, G-D, D-A).
  faq_6: How safe is my privacy?
  faq_6_a: Using the site does not require entering a name or any other information
    other than the email address (since it is used to send match messages). Users
    choose to share their information with others.
  faq_7: I got a matching notice, but nobody answers my messages?
  faq_7_a: We are trying to spot inactive users (those who place wishes that are not
    real and do not respond to messages) and deactivate them from the list of desired
    rotations. Let us know if you notice such "bogus" users
  faq_8: Who created this site?
